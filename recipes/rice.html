    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crispy rice topped with cabbage, bacon, and homemade Okonomiyaki sauce is a delicious Japanese dish you can easily make at home.</p>
    
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>4 thick-cut bacon slices, chopped</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups quick-cooking white rice (such as Minute)</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
  <li>2 cups tap water</li>
  <li>2 medium scallions</li>
  <li>4 cups shredded green cabbage</li>
  <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
  <li>1/2 cup Kewpie mayonnaise, divided</li>
  <li>2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
  <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
  <li>Aonori (seaweed flakes) and lightly crumbled bonito flakes (katsuobushi), optional</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
  <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Cook chopped bacon in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and reserve drippings.</li>
  <li>While bacon cooks, combine rice, salt, and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH for 4 minutes until al dente. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
  <li>Thinly slice scallions, keeping dark and light parts separate. Cook light green parts with cabbage, garlic, and ginger in 1 tbsp bacon fat over medium heat for 3–4 minutes. Add to rice bowl.</li>
  <li>Add half the reserved bacon, 1/4 cup mayonnaise, and 2 tbsp soy sauce to rice mixture. Toss to combine.</li>
  <li>Heat oil and 2 tbsp bacon fat in skillet until sizzling. Press rice mixture into skillet. Poke holes through to the bottom to allow steam to escape and a crust to form.</li>
  <li>Cook until bottom begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until bottom is crisp and golden, 30–35 minutes.</li>
  <li>While baking, mix ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and remaining 1/2 tbsp soy sauce to make Okonomiyaki sauce.</li>
  <li>Remove from oven. Drizzle with sauce and remaining 1/4 cup mayonnaise. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, scallions, bacon, aonori, and bonito flakes if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
